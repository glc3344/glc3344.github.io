Udacity-Neighborhood-Map Project
================================

A single page application featuring a list of breweries in the state of Connecticut.  With Yelp API integration using **Javascript, Knockout.js, jQuery, and HTML/CSS**.

The app allows you to filter the brewery list down as you type. In return, it displays the marker on the map with Yelp information window.

**This project requirements were:**
You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
